# Braidz_GUI
Just me learning how to use PyQt while also building something useful.
Generally, this is a software to visualize and (in the future) do basic data ansylsis on the output from [@astraw](https://github.com/astraw/) [Braidz](https://github.com/strawlab/strand-braid) 3D trakcing system.
Also using an [analysis and filtering package](https://github.com/florisvb/braid_tunnel) from [@florisvb](https://github.com/florisvb/), which I have slightly modified (see [here](https://github.com/elhananby/braid_tunnel)).
